## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT : BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY AUDIT

### OBJECTIVE
Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

## Explanation:

*Length Check:* The tool checks the length of the password and assigns scores based on its length.

*Complexity Check:* This includes checking for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The password's complexity score increases with the variety of character types.

*Common Password Check:* The password is compared against a list of common passwords. If found, the score is penalized.

*Repetition and Sequential Patterns Check:* The tool checks for repetitive characters (e.g., "aaaa") and sequential patterns (e.g., "1234" or "abcd"). If found, the score is reduced.

*Feedback System:* The tool provides feedback based on the password's weaknesses and assigns a strength category (Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong).

## Running the Program:

- Save the code in a file called *'PasswordStrengthChecker.java'*.
- Compile the file using *'javac PasswordStrengthChecker.java'*.
- Run the program using *'java PasswordStrengthChecker'*.
